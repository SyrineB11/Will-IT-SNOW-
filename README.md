# Will it Snow Tomorrow 15 Years Ago?

## Overview

This notebook represents my approach to the 7Learnings Data Scientist challenge. The challenge was engaging and allowed me to showcase my skills in various areas including Python, BigQuery, SQL, and data science.

## Challenge Description

The challenge involved predicting whether it will snow on a specific date 15 years ago. The evaluation criteria included:

- Ability to set up the technical environment
- SQL coding knowledge
- Data cleaning and abstraction
- Understanding of time-dependent data
- Machine learning knowledge and evaluation metrics

## Approach

1. **Technical Environment Setup**: I configured the necessary environment set-up and libraries.
2. **Data Preparation**: Utilized BigQuery and SQL to prepare the appropriate dataframes.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the data to ensure its integrity and suitability for machine learning tasks.
4. **Model Training**: Trained an XGBoost model to predict whether it will snow on the specified date 15 years ago.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using standard metrics.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the 7Learnings team for this opportunity. This challenge was both interesting and educational. Each task sparked multiple ideas and I enjoyed exploring various solutions. I focused on direct and effective methods but included additional thoughts as markdowns.

## Notes

- Each section of the code is thoroughly commented.
- Markdown cells are added to explain each step in detail.
